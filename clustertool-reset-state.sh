  -n,--dryrun            : don't execute commands, just display them
  -d,--no-undrain-nodes  : don't undrain any nodes

 DESCRIPTION

  This is a convenience-tool which does the following on the specified clusters:

   1. undrains all online nodes
   2. unpauses the watcher
   3. removes 'needsreboot' & 'needsmaintenance' tags from all nodes
   4. removes 'locked' tag from all nodegroups

  It is useful after an interrupted clustertool run (once you are sure you've
  manually checked and returned the cluster to a sane state).

  It doesn't have any way of knowing the state before the run, so it just
  naively resets things. This means that for example it will undrain a node
  which was manually drained before a run, and will remove the "locked" tag
  from a nodegroup which was manually tagged as such before the run, so if you
  are not sure about the original state, or need to do anything more
  fine-grained then don't use this tool.

  It won't try to re-online a node offlined during the run, as that just seems
  reckless.
