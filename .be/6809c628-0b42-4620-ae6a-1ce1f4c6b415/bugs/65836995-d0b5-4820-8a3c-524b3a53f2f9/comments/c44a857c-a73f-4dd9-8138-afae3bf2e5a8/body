I have since rewritten the kill code entirely and have also had the parallelism code reenabled for a long time now (but still with the instructions to not use -P, meaning that subshell logic is used, but always with wait afterwards so thing don't actually happen in parallel), without any complaints from anyone. I'll take that as a sign that is no-longer (or wasn't) a bug, and will resolve it.
