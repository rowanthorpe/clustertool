## Usage: ./clustertool-highlight-words.sh "logfilename" "word1" "word2" ...
#
#   Up to 12 distinct colours are cycled through in a loop.
#   Due to the way the colourising is done (and lack of terminal
#   flexibility) you will run into problems if you try to highlight
#   single capital letters or the underscore character. This shouldn't
#   usually be a problem as this is a *word* highlighter, not a *letter*
#   highlighter :-P
#
# EXAMPLE
#
#   ./clustertool-highlight-words.sh /tmp/tmp.fxddFxG2r6/clustertool-roll-2817.log \
#       CMD_i CMD_n CMD_t CMD_s INFO MARK WARN ERROR begin_func end_func start finish resume | \
#       less -R -S
